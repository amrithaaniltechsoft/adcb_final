    title: "NEET UG 2025: Counselling Process & Mandatory Documents",
    excerpt: "Everything you need to know about state and national NEET UG counselling, including registration, choice filling, and essential document verification.",
    content: `<p>Navigating the NEET UG counselling process can feel overwhelming for aspiring medical students. With multiple rounds, strict timelines, and varying rules across national (MCC) and state authorities, keeping track of every detail is critical. This comprehensive guide outlines the step-by-step counselling workflow and lists all mandatory documents you need to secure your MBBS seat.</p>
    
    <h3>1. The Counselling Phases</h3>
    <p>NEET UG counselling is typically conducted in four main rounds:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Round 1:</strong> Initial registration, choice filling, locking, and seat allocation. Upgradation options are available.</li>
      <li><strong>Round 2:</strong> Fresh registration is allowed. Upgraded candidates and new applicants fill fresh choices.</li>
      <li><strong>Round 3 (Mop-up Round):</strong> Conducted to fill remaining seats. Rules regarding seat forfeiture become stricter.</li>
      <li><strong>Stray Vacancy Round:</strong> The final round conducted online/offline to fill any vacant seats. No fresh registration is allowed in some cases.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Essential Documents Checklist</h3>
    <p>Ensure you have at least 3-4 sets of photocopies along with original copies of the following documents:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>NEET UG Admit Card & Scorecard</li>
      <li>Class 10 Mark Sheet & Passing Certificate (for Date of Birth proof)</li>
      <li>Class 12 Mark Sheet & Passing Certificate</li>
      <li>ID Proof (Aadhar Card, Passport, or PAN Card)</li>
      <li>Category Certificate (SC/ST/OBC/EWS, if applicable)</li>
      <li>Domicile/Nativity Certificate (for state quota seats)</li>
      <li>Transfer Certificate (TC) & Migration Certificate</li>
      <li>Recent passport-size photographs (matching the NEET application form)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Choice Filling Strategy</h3>
    <p>When filling choices, always order your preferences with premium government colleges first, followed by top-tier private and deemed universities. Research the clinical patient load, campus infrastructure, and tuition bond details before locking your selections.</p>`,

    excerpt: "Deep dive into MDS clinical and non-clinical branches. Find out which dental specializations have the highest career scope and market demand.",
    content: `<p>A Master of Dental Surgery (MDS) is the ideal pathway for dental graduates seeking clinical expertise and career advancement. However, choosing the right specialization is one of the most critical decisions a dentist will make. In this post, we discuss the top clinical branches in MDS and their prospective career scopes.</p>
    
    <h3>1. Prosthodontics & Crown & Bridge</h3>
    <p>Focuses on dental prosthetics, implantology, and aesthetic dentistry. High demand in private practice and corporate clinic environments due to the rising interest in smile makeovers and dental implants.</p>

    <h3>2. Orthodontics & Dentofacial Orthopedics</h3>
    <p>Concerns the correction of misaligned teeth and jaws. It is one of the most lucrative and popular non-surgical specialties, allowing dentists to establish highly successful exclusive orthodontic clinics.</p>

    <h3>3. Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery</h3>
    <p>The bridge between dentistry and medicine. OMFS surgeons handle complex extractions, facial trauma, jaw reconstruction, and cleft surgeries. It offers intense hospital-based clinical practice and outstanding prestige.</p>

    <h3>4. Conservative Dentistry & Endodontics</h3>
    <p>Root canals and cosmetic dental fillings represent the core patient volume of any general dental practice. Specializing in Endodontics ensures a steady stream of referrals and consulting opportunities.</p>

    <h3>5. Pediatric & Preventive Dentistry</h3>
    <p>With parents prioritizing child healthcare, specialized pediatric dental care is a rapidly growing market. Pediatric dentists specialize in child behavior management and dental treatments under general anesthesia.</p>`,

    title: "How to Secure an MBBS Seat Under NRI/Management Quotas",
    excerpt: "Understanding the eligibility criteria, document requirements, and counselling protocols to qualify for private college NRI and Management quotas.",
    content: `<p>For NEET UG candidates who do not secure government quota seats, private medical colleges and deemed universities offer valuable opportunities through Management and Non-Resident Indian (NRI) quotas. Although these seats carry higher tuition fees, understanding the specific entry rules can help you plan your finances and admission pathway effectively.</p>
    
    <h3>1. What is the NRI Quota?</h3>
    <p>Under Supreme Court directives, private and deemed colleges reserve up to 15% of their total seats for NRI candidates. NRI sponsors (parents, siblings, or close relatives) can sponsor candidates, provided they present valid overseas documents during registration.</p>

    <h3>2. Crucial Documents for NRI Quota Eligibility</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Sponsor’s Embassy Certificate or Consulate Letter.</li>
      <li>Copy of Sponsor’s Passport & Visa/Green Card.</li>
      <li>Relationship Affidavit (stating the link between the candidate and the sponsor).</li>
      <li>NEET UG scorecard and registration receipt.</li>
      <li>Bank account statement of the NRI sponsor showing foreign remittance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Management Quota Counselling</h3>
    <p>Management Quota seats (often designated as Category B or C in states like Telangana and Andhra Pradesh) are filled through open state counselling rounds. Candidates must qualify NEET and register during the state's counselling application window to be considered.</p>`,

    title: "Expert Tips for NEET PG Choice Filling and College Preferences",
    excerpt: "Maximize your chances of landing a desired PG specialty by avoiding common pitfalls during choice filling in state and MCC counselling.",
    content: `<p>The difference between a doctor securing their dream specialty and missing out often boils down to a single factor: choice filling strategy. Even with a high NEET PG score, poor choice ordering or neglecting seat matrices can lead to disappointment. Here are expert strategies to guide your preference list.</p>
    
    <h3>1. Analyzing the Seat Matrix</h3>
    <p>Before filling a single choice, study the seat matrix released by MCC and state counselling bodies. Note the distribution of clinical seats, category-specific quotas, and historically vacant positions across institutions.</p>

    <h3>2. Establish Your Priority: Branch vs. College</h3>
    <p>Decide whether your absolute priority is the specialty branch (e.g., Radio-Diagnosis, General Medicine) or the college branding (e.g., prestigious central institutes). For clinical specialities, patient inflow and hands-on exposure at the hospital are far more critical than fancy campus buildings.</p>

    <h3>3. Understand the Free Exit & Security Deposit Forfeiture Rules</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Round 1:</strong> Generally features a free exit. If you are allotted a seat but do not join, you can participate in Round 2 without penalty.</li>
      <li><strong>Round 2 & 3:</strong> Exiting an allotted seat in these rounds will lead to forfeiture of your security deposit, and in later rounds, you may be barred from further counselling.</li>
    </ul>`,
